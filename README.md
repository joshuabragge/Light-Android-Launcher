Android version
===============
Works with each Android version from 2.0 (API 5)

### E-paper version
One of the goals of the app is to provide smooth experience for older e-paper devices like Nook Simple Touch (NST).
There is a separate development branch "epaper-ready" for this kind of devices. 
The latest apk will always be under [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ci677hmb2s1la5w/LaLauncher-e-paper-unsigned.apk?dl=1) url.

Free & Open Source
==================

### Contribution
Project was done for my personal usage, but I am aware that some people prefer simplicity and some need low battery drain and processor usage - thats why I decided to share the project. Feel free to contribute.
