## Free yourself from huge streams of information

<p><b>Configurable, minimalistic, super lightweight app launcher with a low memory usage and small install size.</b></p>

### How to use
<p>Main screen allows you to add favourite apps.</p>
<p>To go to the all-apps view, just swipe from right to left. Long press on that view allows you to read info about app.</p>

### Free & Open Source
No trackers, no ads, and no device permissions. Open Source Code, available on GPLv2 license.

Fork of https://github.com/Collinux/minimalist-launcher.

### Android version
Works with each Android version from 1.6 (Donut).
   
### Contribution
Project was done for my personal usage, but I am aware that some people prefer simplicity and some need the small battery drain or processor usage - thats why I decided to share the project. Feel free to contribute.
