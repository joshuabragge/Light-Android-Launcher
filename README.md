## Free yourself from huge streams of information

<p><b>Configurable, minimalistic, super lightweight app launcher with a low memory usage and small install size.</b></p>

### How to use

<p>To go to the all-apps view, just swipe top from bottom of screen. Long press on that view allows you to read info about app. To go back to favourites view press back button or swipe from top to maximum half of the screen height.</p>

### Contribution
Project was done for my personal usage, but I am aware that some people prefer simplicity and some need the small battery drain or processor usage - thats why I decided to share the project. Feel free to contribute.
